            Welcome!
            This page is dedicated towards putting together 
            Odin's favourite dishes, along with detailed steps to make them
            just as The All Father would like it, a recipe book, a guide towards 
            being the <em><strong>All Fu*ker's</strong> (RIP, Brok)</em> personal 
            chef.
