# odin-recipes
The recipes project from The Odin Project's Web development course. 

This project is aimed at creating a simple recipes page on the web, a part of TOP's web development course and initally, I will primarily be putting my HTML skills to the test to build this project, so the initial looks of the site may not be as pretty as one would expect. 

Visit the site: https://suryaanshs007.github.io/odin-recipes/

// additional points of reflection elaborating on the html skills put to use for this project will be added below at the end of this project
