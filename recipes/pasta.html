    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        White Sauce pasta is known to be Odin's <em><strong>comfort food.</strong></em>
        With creamy white sauce and an unapologetically bold mix of spices, vegetable garnish
        and special seasoning, the image above best describes what Odin imagines, everytime he craves
        some White Sauce pasta.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>White Sauce Pasta involves boiling pasta, preparing a creamy béchamel sauce, and combining it with vegetables for a simple, Odin style, Italian-inspired dish.</strong>
        Once Pasta is boiled, Sautè vegetables and then proceed to prepare some delicious, Odin-worthy White Sauce <em>(No metaphors here, please.)</em>
    </p>
    <p>With the White Sauce fully prepared and veggies in hand, Odin combines it all, using the heat from his lightning bolt.</p>
