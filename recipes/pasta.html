    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        White Sauce pasta is known to be Odin's <em><strong>comfort food.</strong></em>
        With creamy white sauce and an unapologetically bold mix of spices, vegetable garnish
        and special seasoning, the image above best describes what Odin imagines, everytime he craves
        some White Sauce pasta.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>White Sauce Pasta involves boiling pasta, preparing a creamy béchamel sauce, and combining it with vegetables for a simple, Odin style, Italian-inspired dish.</strong>
        Once Pasta is boiled, Sautè vegetables and then proceed to prepare some delicious, Odin-worthy White Sauce <em>(No metaphors here, please.)</em>
    </p>
    <p>With the White Sauce fully prepared and veggies in hand, Odin combines it all, using the heat from his lightning bolt.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients <em>(Everything Odin wants you to have before you begin)</em>:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g pasta (penne or fusilli)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, broccoli, capsicum), chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup grated cheese (optional <em>although, Odin would love this in his Pasta.</em>)</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, Italian herbs, chili flakes to taste</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>Steps to be taken to prepare <em> Godlike Pasta:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Boil Pasta to Perfection.</h3>
            <p> Bring 4-5 cups water to a boil with ½ tsp salt and a tsp oil. Add pasta and cook <em>al dente</em>
                (firm, about 8-10 minutes per package). Odin does this with magic, you can use an induction stove or a gas stove instead.
                Drain, reserving ½ cup pasta water, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Sautè Vegetables, <em>(Odin Loves his greens)</em></h3>
            
                <p>Heat 1 tbsp butter in a pan, add minced garlic, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add chopped vegetables and stir-fry 4-5 minutes until crisp-tender. Season lightly and remove.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare some <em>God Sauce</em></em></h3>

            <p>
                In the same pan, melt 1 tbsp butter over low heat. Stir in flour and whisk 1 minute to cook without browning. Gradually add cold milk while whisking to avoid lumps; simmer 3-5 minutes until thick (coats spoon back). Stir in cheese, reserved pasta water, salt, pepper, herbs, and chili flakes.
                <em><strong>He wants it spicy like his Rage.</strong></em>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Combine and Serve, <em>the All Father awaits.</em></h3>
            <p>
                Add boiled pasta and veggies to the sauce. Toss over low heat 2 minutes until coated. Garnish with cheese or herbs and serve <strong><em>hot.</em></strong>
            </p>

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>
        Now <em>That</em>, is some incredible White Sauce Pasta, one that will surely catch the All Father's eye <em>(literally, just one eye, he lacks the other one). </em>And if done as per His liking, you might just summon Him!
