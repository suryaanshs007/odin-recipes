    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> 
        Odin is a big sucker for this dish; <em><strong>Poutine</strong></em>
        is a tale of Fries, Curds, Melting Cheese chunks and Gravy. 
        A combination of these items creates a highly desired for dish, 
        one the All Father would <em>kill for</em>. 
        <p>
        <h3>The Origins:</h3>
        Odin watched from his throne in Valhalla, as Midgardians created this dish in rural
        <strong><em>Qubec</em></strong>, in the late <em>1950s</em>
        </p>
        <p>The dish, as the All Father sees it, begins with the 
        preparation of crispy fries via <em>double serving.</em>
        Following this, a <strong>rich beef gravy</strong> from a <em>roux</em> 
        is made, fresh squeaky cheese curds are used, after which hot fries are <em>layered</em>
        and gravy is poured over top to <em><strong>melt (important step, it HAS to undergo gentle liquefaction.)</strong></em>
        the curds slightly.
        </p>

    <h2>Ingredients <em>(Everything Odin wants you to have before you begin)</em>:</h2>
    <ul>
         
            
            <h3>Fries:</h3>
              <li>2 lbs (1 kg) <strong>Russet potatoes</strong>, cut into <em>0.5 inch sticks</em></li>
              <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
              <li>Salt</li>
              
        
        
            <h3>Gravy</h3>
            <li><em>6 tbsp</em> <strong>unsalted butter</strong></li>
            <li><em>0.25 cup</em> <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
            <li><em>3-4 cups</em> <strong>beef broth</strong></li>
            <li><em>1 tbsp</em> <strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong></li>
            <li><em> 1 tbsp </em><strong> ketchup (optional, but of course, The All Father would <em>love this.</em>)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><em>2-3 tbsp</em><strong>cornstarch slurry (for thickening, He wants it <em>thicc</em>).</strong></li>
        
        
            <h3>Topping:</h3>
            <li><em> 2 cups</em> <strong>fresh cheese curds (at room temp, go beyond and you'll disintegrate at the hands of Odin).</strong></li>

        
    </ul>
    
<h2>Steps to be taken to prepare <em> Godlike Pasta:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Peel like you have <em>Valkyrie Nails</em> .</h3>
            <p> Peel and cut potatoes into even fries, soak in cold water 30 minutes to remove starch, then pat dry thoroughly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Heat like you're being bathed in His <em>wrath</em>.</h3>
            
                <p>Heat oil to 275-300°F (135-150°C) for first fry: fry in batches 3-5 minutes until soft but not browned, drain on paper towels, and cool (or freeze for later).</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare some <em>God-Gravy</em></h3>

            <p>For gravy, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat, whisk in flour to form roux, cook 1-2 minutes until bubbling but not browned. Gradually whisk in broth, add Worcestershire, ketchup, salt, and pepper; simmer until thickened <em>(A reminder, Odin likes it <strong>Thicc</strong>)</em>, then stir in cornstarch slurry if needed for gravy consistency.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Heat like you're being bathed in His wrath, <em>again</em>.</h3>
            <p>
                Heat oil to 400°F (200°C) for <em>second </em> fry: fry potatoes <strong>5-7 minutes</strong> until <em>golden and crisp</em>, drain, and season with salt <strong>immediately.</strong>
            </p>
        <li> 
            <h3>Plate and Serve, <em>He awaits.</em></h3>
            <p>
                Plate hot fries, scatter cheese curds on top, and pour hot gravy over to <strong>warm and soften curds without fully melting.</strong> Serve right away with <em>fresh pepper.</em>
            </p>
        

        </li>
    </ol>
