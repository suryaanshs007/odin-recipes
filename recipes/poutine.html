    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p> 
        Odin is a big sucker for this dish; <em><strong>Poutine</strong></em>
        is a tale of Fries, Curds, Melting Cheese chunks and Gravy. 
        A combination of these items creates a highly desired for, 
        a dish the All Father would <em>kill for</em>. 
        <p>
        <h3>The Origins:</h3>
        Odin watched from his throne in Valhalla, as Midgardians created this dish in rural
        <strong><em>Qubec</em></strong>, in the late <em>1950s</em>
        </p>
        <p>The dish, as the All Father sees it, begins with the 
        preparation of crispy fries via <em>double serving.</em>
        Following this, a <strong>rich beef gravy</strong> from a <em>roux</em> 
        is made, fresh squeaky cheese curds are used, after which hot fries are <em>layered</em>
        and gravy is poured over top to <em><strong>melt (important step, it HAS to undergo gentle liquefaction.)</strong></em>
        the curds slightly.
        </p>
